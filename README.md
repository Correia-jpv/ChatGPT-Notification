# ChatGPT Notification

With chatGPT notification, you can say goodbye to constantly checking back on your screen for when the output is generated. This extension makes it easier for you to focus on other tasks while you wait for ChatGPT to do its job.

Once you install chatGPT notification, it will automatically detect when your output is ready and send a sound notification alert to let you know. The notification sound is unique and easy to recognize, so you won't miss it even if you're away from your computer.

## Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Change or configurate the name of your extension on `src/manifest`.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Packing

After development run the command

```shell
$ npm build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
